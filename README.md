# Starry Night VR

Starry Night VR is an immersive and interactive experience in VR based off Vincent Van Gogh's famous painting "Starry Night". This project was made for the final project (TFG) of my Videogame Design and Development degree at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC).

This experience was developed for Oculus Quest 2, and is to be enjoyed using controllers.
